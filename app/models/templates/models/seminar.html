        <h3>Kipoi - Seminar</h3>
        <p>
            The monthly virtual seminar series is designed as a platform for interested Kipoi users and developers and
            will host talks on the applications of deep learning on biological data.
            The seminar is held on every first Wednesday of the month at 5:30 p.m. - 6:30 p.m. CET. We are also happy to
            share the recordings of the seminar on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_iKCHUxepOi7_Wk010--g">YouTube</a>.
        </p>

        <h6> Title: Effective gene expression prediction from sequence by integrating long-range interactions </h6> 3 November 2021 5:30 p.m. - 6:30 p.m. Central European Summer Time
        <p>Speaker: <strong><a>Žiga Avsec</a></strong>, DeepMind, UK</p>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        <p align="justify">
            How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major unsolved problem, and
            critical downstream applications in human genetics depend on improved solutions. Here, we report
            substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequence through the use of a new deep
            learning architecture called Enformer that is able to integrate information from long-range interactions (up
            to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene
            expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel
            reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer–promoter interactions directly from the
            DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these
            advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to
            interpret cis-regulatory evolution.
